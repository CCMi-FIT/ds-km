The **D**ata **S**tewardship **K**nowledge **M**odel project deals with storing questions that a researcher should answer in order to create a Data Stewardship Plan, as well as other related questionnaire data. The knowledge model is stored in a JSON format in accordance with a given [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org). In order to check the validity of the knowledge model description, the schema and other repository content, this project also has a validator.

For more details visit [project wiki](https://github.com/CCMi-FIT/ds-km-core/wiki).

## Tests

All repository content is tested automatically by a validator tool written in Python 3 and its testing tool `pytest` (with extensions). Builds and testing are done by Travis CI automatically and you can run it on your own computer as well.
